# Sample for testing

This sample was developed with [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) library. This sample follows your [Getting started](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server#getting-started). I added a middleware to simulate success and error alternately.

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

## Endpoints
